You’re so excited that you do double time on all your work, laser-mopping every spot you see on the floor, and even polishing the space-faucets in the bathrooms until the soap scum gives way to a high mirror shine.\n\nShe’s there already when you reach the bar, sipping on a drink at a prime window table. From there, you can see airships undocking from the gates, rising into the air, and zipping off to their destinations.\n\n“It’s funny,” she starts. “I’ve been working here for two years, and I’ve never been on one of those.”\n\n“You’re not missing much.” You remember that space-coffee you were supposed to clean up earlier, but let the thought pass by. That and Bethwina don’t really matter right now.\n\n“I’ve been thinking about your question from earlier,” she says, taking your hands into hers.\n\nSomething from outside—a flash—catches your eye. \n\n[[“Did you see that flash?”|43]]\n\n[[“And what did you figure out?”|44]]</div><div tiddler="48" tags="" modified="201309180854" created="201309180854" modifier="twee">“I’ll be back,” you say. “Just stay put.”\n\nYou dart out of the airship and run for the breaker box. Back when Bethwina had you clean the switches, you thought it was punishment for mouthing off about getting all the bad jobs. So she gave you THE WORST. You wouldn’t have dreamed that it would come in handy now.\n\nAnother rumble from above makes you hesitate before you yank open the breaker box. One by one, you pull the levers down. Each time, a set of lights above shuts off. You look behind you at the airship as you pull the last few. Three. Two. And then the last.\n\nAll that interrupts the darkness now are the lights on the airship with Genie aboard. The magnetic locks release, and with the speed of a computer program, the airship backs out of the lock and takes off into the sky, hopefully for a safer location. You hope that whatever is happening isn’t too widespread.\n\n[[Watch as the ship disappears into the sky.|49]]\n</div><div tiddler="43" tags="" modified="201309180850" created="201309180850" modifier="twee">You turn your heads in time to see the explosions outside a split second before the shockwave hits the glass, sending you and Genie flying across the room.\n\nThat moment of warning probably saved your lives. Still clutching hands, you both run through the hallways, ducking with every new explosion that rocks the structure. All around the level, people are screaming in pain and alarm. But you can’t help them. All you can do is try to find a safe spot to hide.\n\nYou decide the best place would be Level C. There, you at least have a chance to escape on one of the airships. But you have to hurry!\n\n[[Don't just sit there! Run!|45]]\n</div><div tiddler="Start" tags="" modified="201309180816" created="201309180816" modifier="twee">It is THE FUTURE, a wonderful time of flying cars, self-baking pizzas, and over-the-counter plastic surgery. The nations of Earth have set aside their weapons and have united under the banner of the world’s biggest and most beloved retailer, SkyMall. Using the bounty of new technologies, brilliant scholars have bettered the human condition through innovations in medicine, manufacturing, and transportation.\n\nOf course, there are also people like you.\n\n[[And what kind of person are you, now?|2]]</div><div tiddler="49" tags="" modified="201309180856" created="201309180856" modifier="twee">It’s dark. You could wander about, but there’s no real use. You wish you could have had one more moment. One last thing to say. You wouldn’t say, “I love you,” because you didn’t know Genie at all. But perhaps with time you could have.\n\nRight now, you wish that you hadn’t wasted the time you did have. If you had everything to do over again, maybe you wouldn’t wait so long to do the things that you always wanted to do.\n\nIt’s dark. It’s dark down here.\n\nTHE END\n</div><div tiddler="24" tags="" modified="201309180835" created="201309180835" modifier="twee">After twenty minutes, you see the faint glimmer of something floating in the distance.\n\nWhen the airship gets close enough, you can see that the Botany Bay looks like an ancient Spanish galleon floating high in the air—complete with cannons that begin to fire at you! “I need you to man the guns while I get us closer!”\n\n“Commercial airships have no guns!”\n\n“Oh,” she says. “Then we're in trouble.”\n\n[[“We can fly above the Botany Bay and parachute onto the deck.”|30]]\n\n[[“Ramming speed!”|31]]\n</div><div tiddler="25" tags="" modified="201309180836" created="201309180836" modifier="twee">You lunge forth with your laser-mop, a battle cry on your lips. There is a moment of triumph as the woman flees from the sight of your warrior’s heart! But only a moment. What she was really doing was ducking and tripping you so that you’d fall head first into the navigation console—the solid tritanium navigation console.\n\nWhen you come to, you find yourself strapped to the co-pilot’s chair in the cockpit. All you can see out the front windshield are blue skies and clouds. This airship is in mid-flight! But who is flying? You look over and see the woman in the captain’s chair, the wheel in her hands.\n\n[[“You’ve heard of Houdini? Dorothy Dietrich? David Blaine? Imbeciles.”|23]]\n\n[[“You’ll never get away with this, you luscious-lipped, lustrously-haired fiend!” |28]]\n</div><div tiddler="26" tags="" modified="201309180837" created="201309180837" modifier="twee">“I hate parlay.” With that utterance, the pirate woman looks deflated. She sinks into the captain’s chair. It isn’t until right then that you’re charmed by the color of her eye and how the light hits her sneer at just the right angle. She’s pretty when she’s angry. You sit down in the co-pilot’s chair to engage in some repartee.\n\n“So talk already,” she says.\n\n[[“Well, well, well… What’s a swarthy girl like you parlaying with a landlubber like me?”|28]]\n\n[[“What are you doing on this ship?”|27]]</div><div tiddler="27" tags="" modified="201309180838" created="201309180838" modifier="twee">“My ship—the Botany Bay—was taken from me. By aliens.” She explains how her ship came across a small vessel floating in the high atmosphere and took it into their cargo hold. Then she relays the grisly tale about how spiny spider creatures emerged, attached themselves to the heads of her crew, and took control of their bodies. She alone managed to get to an escape pod.\n\n“I need this airship to get my crew and the Botany Bay back.”\n\n[[“I have to report you.”|29]]\n\n[[“Count me in, sister!”|24]]\n</div><div tiddler="20" tags="" modified="201309180833" created="201309180833" modifier="twee">“Wanna talk about it?”\n\nGenie spends her lunch break sitting across from you at a cafeteria table. Even though you’re famished, you don’t dare touch your food. There’s nothing grosser than watching someone else eat a piece of meat slathered in sauce, and you’re not about to jeopardize the first honest-to-god awesome thing to happen to you in forever.\n\n“You ever think about being someone else?” you ask. “I mean, like if you were born into another family and raised in a totally different way and could do all these different things—would you still feel—”\n\n“Empty? Lost?” She smiles. “I work in a spaceport food court.” She pokes her microwaved potato. “I think about it every day.”\n\n“I’ve thought about two things for the past three years since I’ve worked here,” you tell her. “One: I want that TSA promotion so badly. It would mean more time off, more chances to travel.&quot;\n\n“And two?”\n\n[[“It’s nothing. Nevermind.”|21]]\n\n[[“What if today is our last day? What if we have nothing but right now?”|42]]\n</div><div tiddler="21" tags="" modified="201309180833" created="201309180833" modifier="twee">As soon as you wave off Genie’s question, you regret it. But there’s no time to take it back. Your wrist communicator lights up, and Bethwina’s irritated voice screams out the tinny speaker:\n\n“I thought I told you to clean up that space-coffee on Level C!”\n\nWell, that’s your cue. Back to work. You say goodbye to Genie, who smiles weakly as she returns to her duties, too.\n\n[[Back to the grind, eh?|22]]\n</div><div tiddler="22" tags="" modified="201309180834" created="201309180834" modifier="twee">Ah. The piquant bouquet of sweat, burning motor oil, and doggie-doo. Good old Level C.\n\n[[Better get to cleaning.|10]]\n\n[[Snoop around one of the airships.|11]]\n</div><div tiddler="23" tags="" modified="201309180835" created="201309180835" modifier="twee">Ha, you silly dog. You’re no escape artist. You cried like a baby when that mime trapped you in his invisible box. That was last week.\n\n“My name is Captain Brynn,” she says. “I need this airship to retake my vessel, The Botany Bay. It and my crew were taken over by aliens when we picked up a strange craft. I was the only one to escape.”\n\nYou try to coax more information out of her, but her steely gaze remains on the airship navigation console. You can’t discern any pattern in the dial readouts to figure out your ultimate fate. \n\nYou see two possibilities:\n\n[[Wait and see what happens like the chump that you are.|24]]\n\n[[Attempt to knock over the cup of coffee in the captain’s seat cup holder onto her.|33]]\n</div><div tiddler="46" tags="" modified="201309180853" created="201309180853" modifier="twee">“Start doing things!” you say. You and Genie push buttons and throw levers, praying to hear a click or a whir or some other signal that you have a chance of getting out of this alive. You flip one last lever, and the airship roars to life. The engines rev, and the navigational flaps start moving of their own accord. A readout on the dash indicates that you’ve just engaged the automatic pilot.\n\nGenie yelps for joy, but it quickly fades, replaced by confusion. An alarm rings throughout the cockpit. A red blinking notice takes over the readout: MAGNETIC LOCKS STILL ENGAGED.\n\n“The flight control tower…. There’s no one manning the locks.” You think fast: “I can cut the power to the entire level. The breaker is at the far end of the platform.” What you don’t tell her is that once that’s done, the airship will immediately lift off. There wouldn’t be enough time for you to cover the distance to make it back.\n\n[[“Wait here. I’ll be back.”|48]]\n\n[[“I’m so sorry. I don’t think it’s possible.”|47]]</div><div tiddler="47" tags="" modified="201309180853" created="201309180853" modifier="twee">“It’s okay,” says Genie. And that’s the last thing you hear before the final explosion that ends your life.\n\nTHE END\n</div><div tiddler="44" tags="" modified="201309180852" created="201309180852" modifier="twee">“I think that we always wish there was more time, and that—if we had to do it over again—we’d maybe not wait so long to do the things we’ve always wanted to do.”\n\nA split second later, an explosive shockwave hits the glass from outside, sending you and Genie flying across the room.\n \nYou spend your last moments curled around Genie’s body. Her hands still clutch yours—tight, tight, tighter than you’ve ever felt anything hold onto you before.\n\nTHE END</div><div tiddler="45" tags="" modified="201309180852" created="201309180852" modifier="twee">You pass by people running the opposite way, and you try to yell out to warn them that it isn’t any safer up on Level A. No use.\n\n“C’mon!” yells Genie. She pulls you down the stairs to the platform where the now deserted gates lay unguarded. Another explosion shakes the ground, and you stumble onto your knees. Genie pulls you up, and together you manage to jump on board one of the airships.\n\nAt the helm, you can’t help but blurt out, “I don’t know how to fly an airship.”\n\n[[“To hell with it. I’m going to try.”|46]]\n\n[[“I’m so sorry.”|47]]</div><div tiddler="28" tags="" modified="201309180840" created="201309180840" modifier="twee">Strangely enough, she giggles. “You’re funny,” she says, twirling her hair.\n\nThis catches you by surprise. “You think…I’m funny? ‘Cause, I mean I really don’t try to be.” But that’s a lie, because you ALWAYS try. Most don’t know that you harbor a secret love of stand-up comedy. Now the universe has given you a sign to go for it! After all, how often does a beautiful and kickass space pirate fall for the musings of a middling-to-lousy member of the Transportation Sanitary Administration?\n\nYou come to the obvious conclusion too late to stop her from hitting the co-pilot eject button. The last thing you think—well, ever—is about how nice the view is up here and how you’ll miss it on the way down, down, down to the cold, hard ground. Happy landings!\n\nTHE END\n</div><div tiddler="29" tags="" modified="201309180840" created="201309180840" modifier="twee">You attempt to contact Bethwina, but the captain proves to be too fast. She wrestles you to the ground before taking a blackjack from her belt and hitting you alongside the head.\n\nWhen you wake up, you are somehow lying back on the Level C platform. Several people huddle above you, most notably members of the Airship Security Squad. They haul you upstairs to their black-walled office where they serve you cookies without milk. Barbarians.\n\nSigh. Looks like that promotion isn’t coming anytime soon. But that’s okay. The Earth blows up long before you get too hung up about it. So it’s not all bad, right?\n\nTHE END\n</div><div tiddler="40" tags="" modified="201309180849" created="201309180849" modifier="twee">“I put you on the PA system. You were on quite the roll.” Yes, you were. Who’d have thunk that an also-ran TSA grunt would have unwittingly saved the world from an alien invasion? Not anyone back at the spaceport, and certainly not this ravishing pirate maven standing before you. “It looks like I’m going to need to take on a new crew. Starting with you.” Oh sweet! If only Bethwina could see you now!\n\n“I could be your first mate!”\n\n“Um, well…I was thinking more along the line of cleanup. Those exploding pirates left a lot of stuff on the decks, and I kind of need someone good with a laser-mop.”\n\nStill, take heart. There is much more adventure as head custodian of The Botany Bay—adventure and much booty to be had!\n\nTHE END\n</div><div tiddler="41" tags="" modified="201309180849" created="201309180849" modifier="twee">With a decisive turn of the wheel, the entire Botany Bay lurches over into a barrel roll.
